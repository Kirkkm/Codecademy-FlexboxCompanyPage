        <h3>Vanguard</h3>
        <p>The heroes that are the tanks of Marvel Rivals. These heroes tend to be physically bigger and have significantly larger health pools than Duelists and Strategists. Their large health pools allow Vanguards to stay alive longer and soak up damage from the enemy team without dying. To give them further survivability, each of these heroes also have at least one way to block or mitigate damage.</p>

        <h3>Duelist</h3>
        <p>The heroes whose design centers around maximum damage output are called Duelists. They typically have abilities that only affect themselves. Players will normally find that Duelist heroes are best positioned in front of their team's Strategists but behind their team's Vanguards, or on the enemy's flank. All of their ultimate abilities are also focused on damage and eliminations.</p>

        <h3>Strategist</h3>
        <p>The heroe who's primary is to enable and support their allies. Typically they will be positioned behind the rest of their team. Healing the damage dealt by the enemy is the main way Strategists support their team.</p>
